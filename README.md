# Article.EikonAPI.Python.ForeshadowingAnalystRevisionsusingLinkUpJobPostingsDataInRefinitivQuantitati
Before LinkUp alternative data was released to our customers, the StarMine Research team had the opportunity to explore the data. An interesting phenomenon we observed was that around the time the company experienced a significant change in jobs (i.e. many added or many removed), the analysts would revise their estimates accordingly in the same direction. The most promising case would obviously be when analyst revisions follow a significant active job postings change a few days or weeks later. However, though there were a lot of cases like that, it was not always so. Sometimes the analyst revisions preceded the active job postings change and sometimes they both changed in tandem.  Hence, we didn't presume that sell-side analysts were watching job postings activity and revising accordingly. Instead our intuition was that the job postings change was a manifestation of the company's view on its future prospects. Perhaps a reaction to a recent event or anticipation of an upcoming event. Either way, we suspect that the analyst revisions occur when analysts finally learn what the company already knows. So when one observes a significant change in active job postings, it's important to check whether analysts have already revised in the same direction. If not, they may very well soon!
